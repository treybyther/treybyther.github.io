                <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML? </h2>
                <p>
                    The difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML, are that a semantic tag is one that 
                    has meaning. Basically, it encompasses how that specific section is going to behave. For example,
                    if you are creating a table, and you use <code>&lt;table</code><code>&gt;</code>, you know that it is going to be 
                    setting up a table, and there is internal instructions on how to set that specific table up. Whereas, with the non-semantic tags,
                    such as <code>&lt;div</code><code>&gt;</code>, it is all internal on the coders end, and there are no acutal 
                    instructions for the program. It doesn't tell you anything specific about what is going to happen
                    to that section essentially. 
                </p>
            </section>
        
            <section id="question2">
                <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One benefit of using a semantic tag is allowing someone who does not understand any sort of HTML to
                            have a slight understanding of what is actually happening in the code. For example, if someone is trying
                            to help you develope your website, and is looking at your code, they would be able to look at it and 
                            actually have an understanding of how you set it up.
                        </li>
                        <li>Another benefit of using a semantic tag is helping yourself remember why you did what you did. I think 
                            when it comes to decoding, having a better sense of how you actually set up your code will help you look 
                            at the specific sections that you have in an organized way and really understand where you went wrong.
