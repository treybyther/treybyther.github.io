        <h2>What did you look up?</h2>
        <p>I looked up the padding css tag.</p>
        <h2>What sites did you consult? Include links to the specific pages on those 4 resources.</h2>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/padding"></a>MDN</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp"></a>W3 Schools</p>
        <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/padding/"></a>CSS Tricks</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/css-responsive-layout"></a>Browser Stack</p>
        <h2>What are the differences in the information presented on each site?</h2>
        <p>On the Browser Stack website, there was no acutal page dedicated to just padding. The only thing that I could
            find was building a responsive page. W3 Schools does padding in pixels, but all of the other websites do it
            in ems, rather than pixels. That's what we learned to do in this class, either vw/vh, so it's interesting
            how that website chose to do that.</p>
        <h2>What features do you think a code reference page should offer?</h2>
        <p>I feel like it should offer code that you can copy to put in and test for yourself, so you can really see
            what the effects are on an actual page. Possibly even a demonstration, with pictures of how it affects the
            page. When looking at code, it can be really confusing as to how that is actually going to affect your page,
            so it would be really nice to know exactly what it's going to look like.</p>
        </h2>Do any of your 4 resources stand out as particularly good or bad?</h2>
        <p>Honestly, I kind of thought they were all the same, other than the one where I couldn't actually find a
            specifc section for how to create and use padding. That stuck out as worse, the Browser Stack one, because
            it was hard to find anything. But all of the other ones did their job.</p>
