                <h2>Difference of absolute and relative CSS length units: </h2>
                <p>
                    The main difference between absolute and relative CSS length units, is that an absolute length is one that is 
                    generally the same size every time. For example, a centimeter is going to be a centimeter and the same amount of 
                    pixels every time. But, with relative CSS length units, like the name says, they are relative to something, usually
                    the screen. So something like vh and vw is actually relative to the viewports screen, and it scales it to the size of 
                    the screen. There is an advantage to using relative CSS length units because it is easier to make sure everything is 
                    scaled correctly when you are trying to set up your website, and it also makes sure that every screen is able to
                    view it the same way. 
                </p>
            </section>
        
            <section id="question2">
                <h2>Definitions:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>px, pt: Pixels (px) and points (pt) are both absolute unit lenghts, so they have a set value of size. A pixel is 1/96th of an inch, and a point is 
                            1/72nd of an inch. You can use the points and the pixels as a set length, and most often times they are used when trying to pick a font 
                            size when you are creating a wesbite.
                        </li>
                        <li>vw, vh: A viewport width (vw) and a vl (viewport length), are essentially a unit type 
                            where the length and width are relative to the screen. So, if something is like 12vw units, that means it is 12 percent of the width 
                            of the viewport. So when you change the size of the viewport, the viewport units are relative and will also shrink alongside with the viewport.
                        </li>
                        <li>vmax, vmin: The viewport maximum (vmax) and viewport minimum (vmin) are very similar to the vw and vh, in that it is relative 
                            to the viewport. A unit of vmax is 1% of the viewport screen. However, it is measured based on which one is the smaller of the two 
                            between the width and the height. If the height is 1200 pixels and the width is 1000 pixels, then the vmax is going to relate to 
                            the height. So a unit of 1 vmax would be 1% of that height of 1200 pixels.
