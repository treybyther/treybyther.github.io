                <h2>The difference between absolute and relative CSS length units </h2>
                <p>
                    The main difference between absolute and relative CSS length units, is that an absolute length is one that is 
                    generally the same size every time. For example, a centimeter is going to be a centimeter and the same amount of 
                    pixels every time. But, with relative CSS length units, like the name says, they are relative to something, usually
                    the screen. So something like vh and vw is actually relative to the viewports screen, and it scales it to the size of 
                    the screen. There is an advantage to using relative CSS length units because it is easier to make sure everything is 
                    scaled correctly when you are trying to set up your website, and it also makes sure that every screen is able to
                    view it the same way.
