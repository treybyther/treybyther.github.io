        <section id="sectionOne">
            <h2>What are the differences between presenting an image using an HTML tag (like
                <code>&lt;img</code><code>&gt;</code>) and presenting it as
                the background of an HTML element (using the CSS property background-image)? Think in terms of
                differences in code as well as differences in functionality and layout.
            </h2>
            <p>The difference between using an image with an HTML tag is that the image is a part of the flow of the
                page. If you see the image to the right of this text, that is put in using HTML, meaning that it is now
                a part of the flow of the page and this response goes around the image. However, a background image with
                CSS is what this background is. It is not a part of the flow of the page, and is just used as
                "decoration" you could say. You can control it with CSS, and in this case, I just set it as the
                background with no changes.</p>

        <section id="sectionTwo">
            <h2>Besides background-image, what other CSS properties affect the display of background images? Describe at
                least two more CSS properties.</h2>
            <p>1. background-attachment: this describes whether or not the background is going to stay in position, and
                move along with the page: ie, this webstie it scrolls with the rest of the page. or if it stays in
                place, and everything else scrolls while it stays fixed in place. </p>
            <p>2. background-repeat: this lets the background image be repeated if the space is too large to take up,
                and the image is not big enough, it says whether or not the image should repeat or not. In this case,
                the background does not repeat, but in the instance the page was too large, it would replicate the image
                as a repeat.</p>

            <h2>In one sentence, how would you define the differences between dimensions and resolution in a bitmap
                image?</h2>
            <p>Dimension describes the amount of pixels that are in an image, whereas the resolution describes how
                closely those pixels are packed in together, creating a so-called "high" or "low" resolution picture.
