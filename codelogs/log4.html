            <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
            <p>
                A CSS media query is aimed to allow for responsive design. Essentially, not all devices are the same
                size. So if you set the font size of your website to a specific point size, it may not come across
                visually as good to someone who is using a phone versus a computer. So, you use a CSS media query to
                allow for extra coding for devices of a certain sizes. This allows your website to have responsive
                design. It’s like an if statement, but for the size of the devices screen.
            </p>

        <section id="section2">
            <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what
                do they do?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Width and Height: Using the viewport width and height, you can use create sizing that will size to
                    specific pixels of screen size. For example, if you wanted your layout to look different on a mobile
                    device versus a laptop, you would use the width and height method to accommodate to those specific
                    screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Orientation: similar to the width and height, the orientation is specific to if your screen is going
                    to be in landscape or portrait mode. You are able to have specific dimensions of your attributes for
                    someone who has their mobile device in portrait or landscape mode.
                </li>
                <li>“AND” logic: You can use this as an extended if statement. So for example, if you wanted a layout to
                    be specific to an ipad in landscape mode, you could set the width and height and the orientation,
                    and that way it would be very specific to that thing.
                </li>
                <li>“OR” logic: in a very similar way, you can use OR logic, in which you are stating that it could
                    either be a specific size OR it could be in landscape.
                </li>
            </ul>
