            <h1>Designing as Visual Organization</h>
                <h2>Excerpts from Chapter 10 of the book On Weaving, by Anni Albers, 1965</h2>

            <p>It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking down
                from an airplane onto this earth. What we see is a free flow of forms intersected here and there by
                straight lines, rectangles, circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by shapes of great regularity.
                Here we have, then, natural and man-made forms in contradistinction. And here before us we can recognize
                the essence of designing a visually comprehensible, simplified organization of forms that is distinct
                from nature’s secretive and complex working.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="para2">
            <p class="callout">“…when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our
                characteristics:
                forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric.” </p>

            <p>Or on a beach, we may find a button, a bottle, a plank of wood, immediately recognizable as “our” doing,
                belonging to our world of forms and not to that which made the shells, the seaweed, and the undulated
                tracings of waves on sand. Also we can observe the counterplay of the forming forces: the sea slowly
                grinding an evenly walled piece of glass, foreign to it in shape and substance, into a multiform body
                suitable for adoption into its own orbit of figuration. On the other hand, we see the waves controlled,
                where dams and dikes draw a rigid line between land and water.</p>

        <section id="para3">
            <p>To turn from “looking at” to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted by nature’s
                fanciful way of planting to scatter them freely about. We may argue that sometimes we follow her method
                and plant a bush here and another there, but even then we “clear” the ground. Always, though sometimes
                in a way that is roundabout and apparent only as an underlying scheme of composition, it is clarity that
                we seek. But when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our
                characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically
                geometric.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="para4">
            <p>If, then, it appears that our stamp is or should be an immediate or implicit lucidity, a considered
                position, a reduction to the comprehensible by reason or intuition in whatever we touch (confusion
                always gets a negative rating), we have established a basis for designing — designing in any field. From
                city-planning to the planning of a house or road, from the composing of music to the formulation of a
                law, the weaving of a fabric, or the painting of a picture — behind the endless list of things shaped is
                a work of clarification, of controlled formulation.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="para5">
            <p class="callout">“Culture, surely, is measured by art, which sets the standard of quality
                toward which broad production slowly moves or should move.”</p>
            
                <p>By using the term “designing” for all these varied ways of pre-establishing form, we are, of course,
                doing some violence to the word. “Designing” usually means “giving shape to a useful object.” We do not
                speak of designing a picture or a concerto, but of designing a house, a city, a bowl, a fabric. But
                surely these can all be, like a painting or music, works of art. Usefulness does not prevent a thing,
                anything, from being art. We must conclude, then, that it is the thoughtfulness and care and sensitivity
                in regard to form that makes a house turn into art, and that it is this degree of thoughtfulness, care,
                and sensitivity that we should try to attain. Culture, surely, is measured by art, which sets the
                standard of quality toward which broad production slowly moves or should move.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="para6">
            <p>For we certainly realize that there are no exclusive materials reserved for art, though we are often told
                otherwise. Neither preciousness nor durability of material are prerequisites. A work of art, we know,
                can be made of sand or sound, of features or flowers, as much as of marble or gold. Any material, any
                working procedure, and any method of production, manual or industrial, can serve an end that may be art.
                It is interesting to see how today’s artists, for example our sculptors, are exploring new media and are
                thereby fundamentally changing the sculptural process from the traditional method of cutting away to one
                of joining. They are giving us, instead of massive contour, exposed structure; instead of opaqueness,
                transmission of light. Obviously, then, regardless of the material and the method of working it,
                designing is or should be methodical planning, whether of simple or intricately organized forms; and if
                done imaginatively and sensitively, designing can become art….</p>

            <p class="callout" id="quote2">“Nevertheless, we are seldom found — on train or plane, on bus or boat, or in
                any given moment of imposed restraint of action — without a bundle of distractions in our hand….”</p>

            <p>Today, we should try to counteract habits that only rarely leave us time to collect ourselves. Every hour
                on the hour we seem to need the latest and, as it turns out, usually the most unsettling and gloomy
                report, often, when seen in retrospect, of non-essentials. Yesterday’s paper is waste paper. Wisdom and
                insight hardly make headlines. Nevertheless, we are seldom found — on train or plane, on bus or boat, or
                in any given moment of imposed restraint of action — without a bundle of distractions in our hand in the
                form of papers or magazines.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="para8">
            <p>And though it may appear that we are straying from our line of thought, it is on the contrary here on the
                ground of philosophy and morals that attitudes and convictions, the starting points of our actions, are
                formed. Two matters here may be of special concern to the conscientious designer and may make him stop
                and think or, perhaps, think and stop. The first is that with his help another object will be added to
                the many that are already taking our attention and our care, another object to distract us. (Our
                households contain hundreds of objects.) The second is that by trying to give this object its best
                possible shape, by trying to make it as timeless as possible — that is, not dictated by short-lived
                fashion — and by finding for it a form as anonymous as possible — that is, a form unburdened by the
                dominantly individual traits of the planner — the designer finds himself in direct conflict with the
                economic pattern of our time.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="para9">
             <p class="callout" id="quote3">“…the designer who takes the longer view is by no means identical with the ‘successful’
                designer.”</p>

            <p>For the economy of today is built largely upon change, and the “successful” designer, a term I have not
                used before, will have to consider the matter of “calculated obsolescence.” We are urged today to want
                more and more things, and we are subjected to a vigorous campaigning for always newer things, things
                that are not necessarily newer in performance. We are asked to shift from red to blue or from this bit
                of trimming to that for the questionable reason or unreason of fashion. It is evident, I think, that the
                designer who takes the longer view is by no means identical with the “successful” designer….</p>
        </section>

        <section id="para10">
            <p>As you will have noticed, I have made no distinction between the craftsman designer, the industrial
                designer, and the artist — because the fundamental, if not the specific, considerations are the same, I
                believe, for those who work with the conscience and apperception of the artist. With surprise and
                reassurance I recently came across a statement by the painter Lionel Feininger, who speaks of one of his
                pictures as having “painted itself.”</p>
        </section>
        <section id="para11">
            <p>At the beginning we spoke here of the comprehensible orderliness which underlies all our doing and whose
                ultimate form is also that of art. Material form becomes meaningful form through design, that is,
                through considered relationships. And this meaningful form can become the carrier of a meaning that
                takes us beyond what we think of as immediate reality. But an orderliness that is too obvious cannot
                become meaningful in this superior sense that is art. The organization of forms, their relatedness,
                their proportions, must have that quality of mystery that we know in nature. Nature, however, shows
                herself to us only in part. The whole of nature, though we always seek it, remains hidden from us. To
                reassure us, art tries, I believe, to show us a wholeness that we can comprehend.</p>
