            <h2>Album Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This was released after his first EP and Album, and was released right around the time that we were all
                being put into quarantine. I really enjoy this EP because yet again, you can immediately tell that it is
                his album just from the first note that he sings. This EP is a good followup, becuase it tunes into his
                more folksy and slower side than before.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Song</h2>
            <p>Maine</p>
            <p>Maine is such a standout on this album, as it has a recognizable beat to open the first entire minute of
                the track. It really sets the mood for the song, and you are immediately taken into the place that he
                wants you to be. The vocals stand out on this track, and it is a song you can just put on repeat, and
                hear something new every time you listen.</p>
