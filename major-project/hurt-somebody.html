            <h2>Album Thoughts</h2>
            <p>For a debut EP, Kahan creates a strong name for himself, establishing not only a strong and unique tone,
                but a very recognizable sound for himself. A country, indie, folk fusion, with a bigger name like Julia
                Michaels featured on the album.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="favSong">
            <h2>Favorite Song</h2>
            <p>Catastrophize</p>
            <p>This is my favorite song because I think it has a catchy, upbeat, and addicting instrumentation. I also
                like how it takes a word like "catastrophize" and makes it into a catchy chorus, which you wouldn't
                immediately think when looking at a word like that. It's a standout on the album in terms of catchiness
                and rememberability.</p>
