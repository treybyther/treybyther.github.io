            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>It's been a long year</p>
            <p>Would we survive in a horror movie?</p>
            <p>I doubt it we're too slow moving</p>
            <p>We trust everyone we meet</p>
            <p>Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens</p>
            <p>Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat</p>
            <p>And stare at a drive-in screen</p>
            <p>We didn't know that the sun was collapsing</p>
            <p>'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing</p>
            <p>We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh</p>
            <p>Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you</p>
            <p>'Til we're food for the worms to eat</p>
            <p>'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours</p>
            <p>Everywhеre, everything, I wanna lovе you</p>
            <p>'Til we're food for the worms to eat</p>
            <p>'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours</p>
            <p>Drive slowly, I know every route in this county</p>
            <p>Maybe that ain't such a bad thing</p>
            <p>I'll tell where not to speed</p>
            <p>It's been a long year</p>
            <p>And all of our book's pages dog-eared</p>
            <p>We'll write out the ends on our palms dear</p>
            <p>Then forget to read</p>
            <p>We didn't know that the sun was collapsing</p>
            <p>'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing</p>
            <p>We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh</p>
            <p>Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you</p>
            <p>'Til we're food for the worms to eat</p>
            <p>'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours</p>
            <p>Everywhеre, everything, I wanna lovе you</p>
            <p>'Til we're food for the worms to eat</p>
            <p>'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours</p>
            <p>Everywhеre, everything, I wanna lovе you</p>
            <p>'Til we're food for the worms to eat</p>
            <p>'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours</p>

            <p> I really love this song as well, with and without the feature. The feature is Gracie Abrams, who is
                another one of my all time favorite artists. Overall, I think that this one is a heartfelt song that I
                really enjoy listening to when I don't want to listen to his sad music. This is an upbeat song, with an
                upbeat message, that he wants to be with someone until he decomposes. It's a sweet song, and it's very
                catchy with great instrumentals. And Abrams's vocals are very beautiful on here.
