            <h2>Album Thoughts</h2>
            <p>As a follow up to Cape Eliabeth, this album you can tell Kahan has settled into his sound, much of which
                you will hear on his current album. Part of Me is a really strong opener track, where he combines sad
                lyrics with an upbeat, folk song. His album explores a piano ballad in Fear of Water, and overall he
                comes out with his strongest album. </p>

            <h2>Favorite Song</h2>
            <p>Fear Of Water</p>
            <p>As a Noah Kahan song, I wouldn't reccomend this to someone getting into his music. However, as a Kahan
                fan, I am a sucker for a piano ballad, and it is just so hauntingly beautiful, and actually brings me to
                tears everytime that I listen to it. If you are looking to be sad, go for this one. Otherwise, I highly
                reccomend Part of Me.</p>
