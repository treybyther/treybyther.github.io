            <h2>Album Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This is his most recent album, and also his best album to date. This is what launched Kahan's career,
                with the song Stick Season reaching 1 billion streams on Spotfiy. This is a no-skip album, where Kahan
                has seriously settled into his sound and created a name for himself. He did end up releasing a second
                version of this album, however it was all the same songs with features on them, so I decided not to
                include it.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Song</h2>
            <p>The View Between Villages</p>
            <p>All 3 of my top favorite songs come from this album, but The View Between Villages really stands out
                amongst the rest for me. It is one of my most streamed songs of all time, and it's because not only does
                he allow you to connect to it on a deep level lyrically, but there a big moments instrumentally that
                really make you feel. </p>
