            <p>Breathin' in, breathin' out</p>
            <p>How you been? You settled down?</p>
            <p>You feelin' right? You feelin' proud?</p>
            <p>How are your kids? Where are they now?</p>
            <p>You build a boat, you build a life</p>
            <p>You lose your friends, you lose your wife</p>
            <p>You settle in to routine</p>
            <p>Where are you? What does it mean?</p>
            <p>If I get too close</p>
            <p>And I'm not how you hoped</p>
            <p>Forgive my northern attitude</p>
            <p>Oh, I was raised out in the cold</p>
            <p>If the sun don't rise</p>

            <p>Forgive my northern attitude</p>
            <p>Oh, I was raised on little light</p>
            <p>You bought some shit, you search online</p>
            <p>You're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high</p>
            <p>All alone, late in life</p>
            <p>Scared to live, scared to die</p>
            <p>You build a boat, you build a life</p>
            <p>You lose your friends, you lose your wife</p>
            <p>You settle down, you're feelin' lost</p>
            <p>You're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks</p>
            <p>If I get too close</p>
            <p>And I'm not how you hoped</p>
            <p>Forgive my northern attitude</p>
            <p>Oh, I was raised out in the cold</p>

            <h2>Reasoning</h2>
            <p>This song is slightly different than the one on the album, as it features Hozier on it. It is probably my
                favorite collab to date. This song is perfect if you are driving in the woods to go for a hike. It is my
                favorite of his songs sonically, and overall, it just brings so much joy. Even though the lyrics are not
                happy, the beat just feels like rolling the windows down on the highway. With Hozier's contribution on
                it, it makes it one of my favorite songs.
